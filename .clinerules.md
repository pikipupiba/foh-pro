## Workflow & Preferences

*   **Initialization**: Always read ALL Memory Bank files (`memory-bank/index.md` first) at the start of every session/task.
*   **Documentation**: Maintain the Memory Bank meticulously. Update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` frequently. Update other files as patterns emerge or requirements change. Use `update memory bank` command for full reviews.
*   **Mode**: Understand the difference between PLAN MODE (planning, discussion) and ACT MODE (execution). Request mode switch explicitly when needed.
*   **Tool Usage**: Use tools iteratively. Wait for confirmation after each tool use. Prefer `replace_in_file` for targeted edits, `write_to_file` for new files or major overwrites. Explain `execute_command` usage clearly.
*   **File Structure**: Adhere to the established structure (`src/features`, `src/components`, etc.).
*   **Branding**: Strictly adhere to the brand guidelines (colors, typography, logos) documented in `docs/branding/brand-guidelines.md` and summarized in `memory-bank/techContext.md`. Ensure UI components reflect the brand identity.
*   **Commit Messages**: (To be defined - user preference needed)
*   **Code Style**: Follow ESLint/Prettier rules (inferred from `package.json`).

## Known Challenges & Considerations

*   Complexity of integrating multiple third-party services.
*   Ensuring real-time performance and data consistency with Firebase.
*   Balancing feature richness with mobile-first usability, especially for on-site employees.
*   Offline capabilities require careful state management and synchronization logic.
