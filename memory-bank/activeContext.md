# Active Context (foh-pro)

**Date:** 2025-03-29

## Current Focus

*   Initial project setup and Memory Bank initialization.

## Recent Changes

*   Initialized Memory Bank and incorporated branding guidelines.
*   **Verified Scaffold**: Listed contents of `src/` directory using `list_files` to confirm scaffold structure exists.
*   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the scaffolded state.
*   **Verified Development Workflow**: Successfully ran `npm run dev`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (after installing `ts-jest` and `jest-environment-jsdom`), and `npm run storybook` (after updating script in `package.json`, creating `.storybook/main.ts`, and installing `@storybook/addon-interactions`).
*   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` again to note successful workflow verification.
*   Updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file).
*   **Firebase Setup**: User created Firebase project, installed CLI, ran `firebase init`, and provided config.
*   **Firebase Integration**: Created `src/lib/firebase/firebaseConfig.ts` with provided credentials and initialized SDK exports (app, auth, db, storage, analytics).
*   **Firebase Hosting Deployment**:
    *   Configured Next.js for static export (`output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`) to align with Firebase Hosting's `public` directory setting (`out`).
    *   Added `cleanUrls: true` to `firebase.json` to handle extensionless URLs correctly.
    *   Successfully built and deployed the application and configuration changes, resolving the 404 error on `/firebase-test`. Tested basic Firestore connectivity via the deployed page.
*   **Tailwind CSS v4 Setup**:
    *   Installed `@tailwindcss/postcss`, removed `autoprefixer`.
    *   Created `postcss.config.js` using `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
    *   Created `src/styles/globals.css` with `@import "tailwindcss";` and `@theme` definitions for brand colors.
    *   Created `src/pages/_app.tsx` to import `globals.css`.
*   **Firebase Test Page Enhancement**:
    *   Expanded `src/pages/firebase-test.tsx` to include tests for Authentication (Anonymous Sign-in/out), Firestore (Update, Delete, Real-time Subscription), and Cloud Storage (File Upload).
    *   Restyled the page using Tailwind v4 classes and CSS theme variables for a cleaner UI.
    *   Successfully built and redeployed the enhanced test page.

## Next Steps

*   Firebase project is connected, SDK is configured, initial deployment to Hosting is successful, and a comprehensive test page is available and styled.
*   Next logical steps could include:
    *   Implementing basic Firebase Authentication (e.g., simple login/signup form, Auth context).
    *   Defining initial Firestore data models and security rules (`firestore.rules`).
    *   Creating a basic page/component that interacts with Firebase (e.g., reading/writing data).
*   Await user direction for the next task.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Ensuring the initial Memory Bank accurately reflects the provided source documents.
*   Establishing the baseline understanding of the project structure, goals, and technology stack.
