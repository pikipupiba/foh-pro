# Active Context (foh-pro)

**Date:** 2025-03-29

## Current Focus

*   Initial project setup and Memory Bank initialization.

## Recent Changes

*   Initialized Memory Bank and incorporated branding guidelines.
*   **Verified Scaffold**: Listed contents of `src/` directory using `list_files` to confirm scaffold structure exists.
*   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the scaffolded state.
*   **Verified Development Workflow**: Successfully ran `npm run dev`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (after installing `ts-jest` and `jest-environment-jsdom`), and `npm run storybook` (after updating script in `package.json`, creating `.storybook/main.ts`, and installing `@storybook/addon-interactions`).
*   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` again to note successful workflow verification.
*   Updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file).
*   **Firebase Setup**: User created Firebase project, installed CLI, ran `firebase init`, and provided config.
*   **Firebase Integration**: Created `src/lib/firebase/firebaseConfig.ts` with provided credentials and initialized SDK exports (app, auth, db, storage, analytics).

## Next Steps

*   Firebase project is connected and SDK is configured in the codebase.
*   Next logical steps could include:
    *   Implementing basic Firebase Authentication (e.g., simple login/signup form, Auth context).
    *   Defining initial Firestore data models and security rules (`firestore.rules`).
    *   Creating a basic page/component that interacts with Firebase (e.g., reading/writing data).
*   Await user direction for the next task.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Ensuring the initial Memory Bank accurately reflects the provided source documents.
*   Establishing the baseline understanding of the project structure, goals, and technology stack.
