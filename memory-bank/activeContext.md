# Active Context (foh-pro)

**Date:** 2025-03-29

## Current Focus

*   Initial project setup and Memory Bank initialization.

## Recent Changes

*   Created the initial set of Memory Bank files (`index.md`, `.clinerules.md`, `.clinerules-windows`, `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   **Incorporated Feedback**: Read `docs/branding/brand-guidelines.md` and updated Memory Bank:
    *   Added branding details (colors, typography, logos, domain) to `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
    *   Added a rule to `.clinerules.md` emphasizing adherence to brand guidelines.
    *   Updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file).

## Next Steps

*   Memory Bank initialization, including branding guidelines integration, is complete.
*   Await the next task from the user.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Ensuring the initial Memory Bank accurately reflects the provided source documents.
*   Establishing the baseline understanding of the project structure, goals, and technology stack.
