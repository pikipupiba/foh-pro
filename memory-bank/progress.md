# Project Progress (foh-pro)

**Date:** 2025-03-29

## Current Status

*   **Phase**: Initial Setup / Scaffolding
*   **Overall Progress**: Core configurations (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.) and detailed `src/` directory scaffold (features, components, pages, contexts, hooks, lib, services, store, styles, utils) are in place. Memory Bank initialized and updated with branding. Implementation within the scaffold is pending (files likely contain placeholders or are empty).

## What Works

*   Base Next.js project setup (can likely run `npm run dev`).
*   Core configuration files exist.
*   Dependency installation (`npm install`) should work.
*   Memory Bank structure created and populated with initial context + branding.
*   `src/` directory structure scaffolded according to design (verified via `list_files`).
*   Core development scripts (`dev`, `lint`, `test`, `storybook`) confirmed functional after necessary dependency installations and configuration fixes.
*   Firebase project created and linked via `firebase init`.
*   Firebase SDK configured in `src/lib/firebase/firebaseConfig.ts`.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level based on Project Brief)

*   **Authentication**: User sign-up, login, password reset flows for all roles.
*   **Public Pages**: Home, Services, Product Listings (implementing SSG/SSR).
*   **Customer Portal**: All features outlined in the brief (Pre-Rental, Event Planning, Post-Event).
*   **Employee Portal**: All features outlined in the brief (Logistics, Workflow, On-Site Tools).
*   **Admin Portal**: All features outlined in the brief (Dashboards, Scheduling, Monitoring, etc.).
*   **Firebase Configuration**: Detailed Firestore data modeling, security rules (`firestore.rules`), Cloud Functions implementation (`functions/`), Storage rules (`storage.rules`).
*   **Third-Party Integrations**: Implementation for Current RMS, QuickBooks/Xero, Google Workspace, Social Media, etc.
*   **UI Implementation**: Building out components based on design (using Tailwind, Framer Motion, Storybook).
*   **Testing**: Writing unit, integration, and E2E tests for all features.
*   **CI/CD**: Setting up GitHub Actions workflows.

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   None identified at this initial stage, beyond the large scope of work remaining.

## Next Milestones (Tentative)

1.  **Firebase Setup & Basic Auth**: Project connected, SDK configured. Next: Implement basic Authentication flow.
2.  Implement basic layout components.
3.  Build out initial public-facing pages (e.g., Home page with SSG).
4.  Start development on one of the core portals (e.g., Customer Portal - Pre-Rental features).
