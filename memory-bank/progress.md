# Project Progress (foh-pro)

**Date:** 2025-03-29

## Current Status

*   **Phase**: Planning / Initial Setup
*   **Overall Progress**: Project structure and core configurations are in place. Memory Bank initialized. No application features have been implemented yet.

## What Works

*   Base Next.js project setup (can likely run `npm run dev`).
*   Core configuration files exist (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.js`, `firebase.json`, etc.).
*   Dependency installation (`npm install`) should work.
*   Memory Bank structure created and populated with initial context.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level based on Project Brief)

*   **Authentication**: User sign-up, login, password reset flows for all roles.
*   **Public Pages**: Home, Services, Product Listings (implementing SSG/SSR).
*   **Customer Portal**: All features outlined in the brief (Pre-Rental, Event Planning, Post-Event).
*   **Employee Portal**: All features outlined in the brief (Logistics, Workflow, On-Site Tools).
*   **Admin Portal**: All features outlined in the brief (Dashboards, Scheduling, Monitoring, etc.).
*   **Firebase Setup**: Detailed Firestore data modeling, security rules, Cloud Functions implementation.
*   **Third-Party Integrations**: Implementation for Current RMS, QuickBooks/Xero, Google Workspace, Social Media, etc.
*   **UI Implementation**: Building out components based on design (using Tailwind, Framer Motion, Storybook).
*   **Testing**: Writing unit, integration, and E2E tests for all features.
*   **CI/CD**: Setting up GitHub Actions workflows.

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   None identified at this initial stage, beyond the large scope of work remaining.

## Next Milestones (Tentative)

1.  Setup Firebase project connection and basic Authentication flow.
2.  Implement basic layout components.
3.  Build out initial public-facing pages (e.g., Home page with SSG).
4.  Start development on one of the core portals (e.g., Customer Portal - Pre-Rental features).
