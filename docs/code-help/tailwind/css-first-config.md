Your understanding of integrating Tailwind CSS v4 with Next.js 15 is largely accurate, but some nuances are worth clarifying. With the release of Tailwind CSS v4, the framework has shifted to a CSS-first configuration approach, eliminating the need for the traditional `tailwind.config.js` file. This change simplifies the setup process and enhances performance.

In Tailwind CSS v4, you can define your design tokens directly within your CSS files using the `@theme` directive. This method allows you to specify theme variables such as colors, fonts, and spacing without relying on a separate JavaScript configuration file. For example, in your `globals.css`, you can define theme variables like this:


```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --color-primary: #1d4ed8;
  --font-sans: ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif;
  /* Additional theme variables */
}
```


This approach ensures that all your design tokens are centralized within your CSS, promoting a more streamlined and cohesive development process. The `@theme` directive not only defines CSS variables but also generates corresponding utility classes that you can use throughout your application. For instance, defining `--color-primary` will automatically create utility classes like `bg-primary` and `text-primary`. citeturn0search3

Regarding the `content` array, Tailwind CSS v4 introduces automatic content detection, reducing the need for manual configuration. The framework intelligently scans your project to identify the relevant files that contain Tailwind class names. However, if you need to include additional directories or files that aren't detected by default, you can use the `@source` directive directly in your CSS file:


```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@source "../node_modules/@my-company/ui-lib";
```


This directive allows you to specify additional paths for Tailwind to scan, ensuring that all your utility classes are generated appropriately. citeturn0search1

In summary, with Tailwind CSS v4 and Next.js 15, there's no need to restore or maintain a `tailwind.config.js` file. By leveraging the `@theme` and `@source` directives within your CSS files, you can effectively configure and customize Tailwind CSS to suit your project's needs. This integration should work seamlessly with the Next.js development server when running `npm run dev`.
