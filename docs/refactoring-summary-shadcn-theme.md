# Refactoring Summary: shadcn/ui Integration &amp; Theming (2025-03-31)

This document summarizes the refactoring work undertaken to integrate the shadcn/ui component library, establish a consistent theme, and implement theme switching.

## Goals Achieved

1.  **shadcn/ui Integration:** Successfully initialized shadcn/ui for the project, leveraging its compatibility with Tailwind v4 and React 19.
2.  **Theme Definition:** Defined a new application-wide theme using HSL color values provided by the user. This theme is configured in `src/styles/globals.css` using CSS variables in `:root` and `.dark` scopes, mapped for Tailwind via `@theme inline`.
3.  **Component Refactoring:**
    *   Replaced standard HTML elements (buttons, inputs, labels) in authentication forms (`LoginForm`, `SignupForm`) with their shadcn/ui counterparts (`Button`, `Input`, `Label`).
    *   Refactored the `AuthStatus` component to use shadcn/ui `Avatar` and `DropdownMenu` for logged-in users, and `Button` for the login link.
    *   Updated the header navigation to use shadcn/ui `NavigationMenu`.
    *   Updated `Header` and `Footer` components to use theme variables (`bg-background`, `text-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`) for consistent styling.
    *   Corrected styling for the "OR" divider in auth forms to use `bg-card`.
4.  **Theme Switching:**
    *   Installed and configured the `next-themes` library.
    *   Implemented a `ThemeToggle` component (`src/components/layout/ThemeToggle.tsx`) using shadcn/ui `DropdownMenu` and `Button`.
    *   Added the `ThemeToggle` to the main `Header`.
    *   Removed forced dark mode from login/signup pages, allowing them to respect the selected theme.
5.  **Component Availability:** Installed a wide range of common shadcn/ui components via a script (`scripts/add_shadcn_components.ps1`) for future use, including `separator`, `sheet`, `dialog`, `tabs`, `accordion`, `tooltip`, `alert`, `alert-dialog`, `select`, `checkbox`, `radio-group`, `switch`, `textarea`, `table`, `skeleton`, and `sonner`.
6.  **Issue Resolution:** Resolved initial issues with Tailwind v4 configuration not recognizing custom colors and fixed various syntax errors during the refactoring process.

## Outcome

The application now has a consistent theme based on the provided HSL values, leverages shadcn/ui components for core UI elements, and includes a functional theme toggle. This provides a solid foundation for future UI development.
